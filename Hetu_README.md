[Documentation](https://hetu-doc.readthedocs.io) | [Examples](https://hetu-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Overview/performance.html)

Hetu is a high-performance distributed deep learning system targeting trillions of parameters DL model training, developed by <a href="http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DAIR Lab</a> at Peking University. It takes account of both high availability in industry and innovation in academia, which has a number of advanced characteristics:

- Applicability. DL model definition with standard dataflow graph; many basic CPU and GPU operators; efficient implementation of more than plenty of DL models and at least popular 10 ML algorithms.

- Efficiency. Achieve at least 30% speedup compared to TensorFlow on DNN, CNN, RNN benchmarks.

- Flexibility. Supporting various parallel training protocols and distributed communication architectures, such as Data/Model/Pipeline parallel; Parameter server & AllReduce.

- Scalability. Deployment on more than 100 computation nodes; Training giant models with trillions of model parameters, e.g., Criteo Kaggle, Open Graph Benchmark

- Agility. Automatically ML pipeline: feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter search.

We welcome everyone interested in machine learning or graph computing to contribute codes, create issues or pull requests. Please refer to [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.

2. Prepare the environment. We use Anaconda to manage packages. The following command create the conda environment to be used:`conda env create -f environment.yml`. Please prepare Cuda toolkit and CuDNN in advance.

3. We use CMake to compile Hetu. Please copy the example configuration for compilation by `cp cmake/config.example.cmake cmake/config.cmake`. Users can modify the configuration file to enable/disable the compilation of each module. For advanced users (who not using the provided conda environment), the prerequisites for different modules in Hetu is listed in appendix.

```bash
# modify paths and configurations in cmake/config.cmake

# generate Makefile
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..

# compile
# make all
make -j 8
# make hetu, version is specified in cmake/config.cmake
make hetu -j 8
# make allreduce module
make allreduce -j 8
# make ps module
make ps -j 8
# make geometric module
make geometric -j 8
# make hetu-cache module
make hetu_cache -j 8
```

4. Prepare environment for running. Edit the hetu.exp file and set the environment path for python and the path for executable mpirun if necessary (for advanced users not using the provided conda environment). Then execute the command `source hetu.exp` .



## Usage

Train logistic regression on gpu:

```bash
bash examples/cnn/scripts/hetu_1gpu.sh logreg MNIST
```

Train a 3-layer mlp on gpu:

```bash
bash examples/cnn/scripts/hetu_1gpu.sh mlp CIFAR10
```

Train a 3-layer cnn with gpu:

```bash
bash examples/cnn/scripts/hetu_1gpu.sh cnn_3_layers MNIST
```

Train a 3-layer mlp with allreduce on 8 gpus (use mpirun):

```bash
bash examples/cnn/scripts/hetu_8gpu.sh mlp CIFAR10
```

Train a 3-layer mlp with PS on 1 server and 2 workers:

```bash
# in the script we launch the scheduler and server, and two workers
bash examples/cnn/scripts/hetu_2gpu_ps.sh mlp CIFAR10
```


## More Examples
Please refer to examples directory, which contains CNN, NLP, CTR, GNN training scripts. For distributed training, please refer to CTR and GNN tasks.
